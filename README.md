# ToasterSL (toasterscriptloader)
Script manager, terminal ui (text based), scripts pulled from tomeczeklmaodev/scripts repository.

### TODO
* Add option selection using keyboard
* Make buffer size update dynamically to window size, so the text alignment won't look hardcoded (still haven't figured out how to do it)
* Create arguments
* Fix Makefile so I don't have to hardcode every source file into it :(
* Make README look better
* Create a website for this project
